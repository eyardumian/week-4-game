# week-4-game
This is a JavaScript and jQuery based game in which you collect gems to get to a target score.

Basic operation:

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
When the player clicks on a crystal, it's value will be added to the player's total score.
The value of each crystal is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each crystal is clicked.
The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number.
The player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.
The number of games won and lost will be displayed.
When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, and all the crystals will have new hidden values.
